# project-3-frontend

This app is inspired by Reddit, and is a basic message board. User interactions are:
* logging in / user AUTH
* making a post
* viewing posts by community
* search posts
* like posts
* comment on posts

## Technologies / What's Used
This app uses React, Express, Mongo, and Node.js, with CSS styling.

The React front-end interacts with our custom API server.

Within react, we created six custom components. Ternaries were also used for displaying conditional elements.

## Challenges
User authentication was a big challenge for this project, and took up lots of hours.

Another challenge was to figure out how to push the "likes" and "comments" to the back-end server.

## Teamwork
A major goal of this project was to learn how to collaborate with a teammate via Git. Kevin and Greg worked together, with a team huddle every morning to merge the previous day's work, and discuss that days's objectives. Trello was used to track tasks and their status, and to ensure no work was duplicated.

## Issues
The site works as expected, but the comment system is unfortunately buggy, and works intermittently. There wasn't enough time to troubleshoot and update with a working version before the project was due.
